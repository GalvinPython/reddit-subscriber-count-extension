You may be going "Doesn't Reddit already have this?". Well it **did**, but not anymore

# What this extension does

On Tuesday 9th September 2025, Reddit started replacing the subscriber count on subreddits to ["weekly activity"](https://x.com/Dexerto/status/1965779215883624610) to drive engagement. However people may just want to see the subscriber count instead
